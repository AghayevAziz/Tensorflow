This project predicts number <br>
1.png >>>  Model predicts it as 7, because of the straight line similar with 7 <br>
2.png >>>  Model predicts it as 2, down side may help it in prediction <br>
3.png >>>  Model predicts it as 3, may be the curves of number 3 help it in prediction <br>
4.png >>>  Model predicts it as 4, beacuse it looks like print 4 <br>
5.png >>>  Model predicts it as 5, may be the curves of number 5 help it in prediction <br>
6.png >>>  Model predicts it as 5, because if we close down left side, it looks like 5 <br>
7.png >>>  Model predicts it as 7, because it looks like print 7, and angle between straight lines may help it to predict 7 <br>
8.png >>>  Model predicts it as 8, 2 circles in the picture may help it to predict number 8 <br>
9.png >>>  Model predicts it as 9, because it looks like handwriting 9 <br>
0.png >>>  Model predicts it as 0, because it looks like circle as 0 <br>
